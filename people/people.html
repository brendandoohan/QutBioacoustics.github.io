                Dr. Michael Towsey has held research positions at QUT since 1997. He uses machine learning methods to
                solve biological problems. These have ranged from the sublime (analysis of bird song) to the ridiculous
                (analysis of milk yield in cow herds) with some bioinformatics in between! Michael is currently in the
                Bioacoustics Research Group within the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at QUT. He
                works on the ‘big data’ problems associated with long duration recordings of the environment, in
                particular, building recognizers for species of interest, extracting acoustic indices to aid navigation
                and visualisation.

                Mark Cottman-Fields is a PhD student. His research is titled Engaging Expert Birders to Analyse
                Environmental
                Bioacoustic Data. The recordings that the research group obtains from the field are used to prototype
                website interfaces for birders to listen and identify bird vocalisations. In order to extend birders’
                physical activities online, allowing them to make use of existing expertise, his work includes
                investigating
                the established culture and practice of birders. This research will provide straight-forward and
                engaging
                online activities that build on and make use of physical experiences. The online tools produced form
                this
                work will support the creation of large-scale observational data for ecologists.

                Combining automated and non-automated methods of acoustic analysis for bird species richness surveys.
                Phil's research will explore ways of using automated acoustic analysis to determine rich and diverse
                subsets of a long recording. This will speed up the process of a manual species richness survey
                conducted by a human, as they will need to listen to less audio to observe all the species present.

                assistant working for the bioacoustics research group. He supports other researchers within the group by
                managing data, running large scale analyses on large compute resources, and by developing professional
                bioacoustic analysis software for the web.
